# Abstract {-}

The project is motivated by the need for exploring and mining information from the air quality data in Auckland by the Auckland Council in order to understand the variation of air pollutants over time and their correlation with meteorological factors. Therefore, this project delivers a storytelling dashboard with interactive graphics as a web application developed using the **R shiny** package, available at [https://szmsu2011.shinyapps.io/akl-air-quality](https://szmsu2011.shinyapps.io/akl-air-quality). The works focus on researching appropriate methods of data visualisation and statistical toolboxes for temporal air quality data from existing open-source libraries then assembling them into a modularised application with interactive linkings. Each module corresponds to a tab set of interactive graphics for a specific purpose, altogether providing a coarse-to-granular exploration for the statistical features of air quality in Auckland. The modularisation allows easy maintenance and offers extensibility for new functional needs, achieved by reactive programming and event handling functions of the **R shiny** package.
