## Exponential smoothing (Template Demo) {#sec:expsmooth}

Exponential smoothing was originally developed in the late 1950s [@Brown59;@Brown63;@Holt57;@Winters60]. Because of their computational simplicity and interpretability, they became widely used in practice.

Empirical studies by @MH79 and @Metal82 found little difference in forecast accuracy between exponential smoothing and ARIMA models. This made the family of exponential smoothing procedures an attractive proposition [see @CKOS01].

The methods were less popular in academic circles until  @OKS97 introduced a state space formulation of some of the methods, which was extended in @HKSG02 to cover the full range of exponential smoothing methods.
