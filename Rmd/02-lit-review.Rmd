# Background and related works {#ch:litreview}

Modern information design has been continuously fostering effective tools of organising and displaying information since @tufte proposed the landmarking principles of graphical displays in *The Visual Display of Quantitative Information*. Following the disruptive advancement of information and computing technology, infographics designers are faced with unprecedented methods of data display, including interactive and animated graphics.

As such, the prerequisites of a successful design of a storytelling dashboard for visualising the air quality data are the appropriate implementations of suitable data and graphical toolboxes. As the main features of interest in air quality data are temporal, this section will briefly outline the available toolboxes for time series data wrangling and visualisation using **R** [@R2021].

## Tidy time series data-wrangling toolbox

The **tsibble** package offers a data infrastructure for wrangling time series data [@tsibble]. A time series data set consists of one or more sequences indexed by time, often with a regular interval. As such, data-wrangling processes of time series data need to account for the special requirements of time series data analysis, including the explicit identification of time gaps and a method of handling multiple time series in a single data set for identifying duplicate records.

Analyses of fixed-interval time series require the data to be free from missing value, especially when the series is self-dependent. Whilst the explicit missing values can be easily handled by the substitution with interpolated values, the implicit gaps with missing index values are often neglected. In the case of multiple time series, locations of implicit time gaps may be different in each sequence; filling the gaps with traditional loops can be time-consuming and inefficient. **tsibble** identifies implicit time gaps with the *index* and *key* variables, such that each variable in the tsibble object is uniquely identified by the index and the interaction of all keys. As such, each time series is uniquely identified by the keys, allowing efficient identification of implicit time gaps, which is achieved by **tsibble** with a range of wrangling verbs.

Duplicates exist in different forms in cross-sectional and time series data. Typically, duplicates are identical observations exhibited as rows in a data frame, yet such definition is inadequate in identifying duplicates in time series data. There exists only one true value at any given point in time for each time series, meaning that there may be duplicate values that are non-identical observations with identical key-index pairs yet different in values. Instead of searching merely for duplicate rows, **tsibble** checks for duplicate key-index pairs. To avoid negligence, the creation of tsibble will fail upon detected duplicates.

## Time series graphics toolbox

### Calendar graphics

Calendars are the systematic partition of time from the observed solar-lunar phenomena and cultural custom, which is usable as graphics for temporal representations of societal activities and natural events. Calendar graphics are the method for the aggregated visualisation of time series data at sub-daily intervals, depicting the temporal dimension of time series data as the spatial layout in the calendar grid. The motivation of utilising calendars for data visualisations arises from the convenience of displaying observations in association with exact dates.

Air quality data are conventionally collected at hourly intervals, from which a time series plot becomes overcrowded, impeding the visual detections of abnormalities. @calmap depicted a method of non-cartesian heatmaps on a calendar coordinate for visualising air pollution data. Prior to the paper, @calmapi used calendar heatmaps to analyse the correlation of particulate matter temporally. Calendar graphics highlight the abnormalities and allow the association of the detected abnormalities to events with dates, providing insights and directions for analyses.

Calendar graphics is an application of trellis displays [@trellis], which spatially modularise the temporal dimension into conditional groups of small multiples [@tufte] using calendar period (i.e., month and year) as an integrated and aligned plot. The expanded layout of the temporal dimension on a plane eases the cognitive load [@tufte] in temporally locating the date of the events and extracting the date components, contrary to conventional time series plots.

```{r cal-demo, fig.width = 7, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:cal-demo-cap)"}
include_graphics("figures/cal-demo.png")
```

(ref:cal-demo-cap) Calendar heatmap. Produced with **Echarts.js** [@echarts] via **echarts4r** [@echarts4r] faceted (unaligned) by `year ~ month`. Each tile corresponds to the value of an observed day or aggregated sub-daily observations, whose exact date and day of the week are easily identifiable.

### Time series plots

In most scenarios, visualising time series relies on connecting points of observations with lines, curves or splines [@dataviz-ts], such that the sequences are plotted against the time index by positions along common xy-scales on the Cartesian coordinate [@fpp3]. Connected time plots are the most elementary visual method for spotting extrinsic features in time series, including trends, seasons, cycles, clustering and oscillations.

```{r ctp-demo, fig.width = 7, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:ctp-demo-cap)"}
ansett %>%
  filter(Airports == "MEL-SYD", Class == "Economy") %>%
  mutate(Passengers = Passengers / 1000) %>%
  autoplot(Passengers) +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    title = "Ansett airlines economy class",
    subtitle = "Melbourne-Sydney",
    y = "Passengers ('000)"
  )
```

(ref:ctp-demo-cap) Line plot. Produced with the **ggplot2** package [@ggplot2] for the weekly economy passenger load on Ansett Airlines [@fpp3d]. Visual analysis shows weak trend and cycle and abnormal zero values to be investigated. The presence of clustering also indicates a positive temporal dependence in the time series. It is nonetheless uneasy to align any observation to a date accurately.

Based on connected time plots, @feasts proposed the seasonal plot as a method of visualising seasonal patterns in the **feasts** package. The method conditionally subsets the complete time series into partitions of seasonal periods, each to be plotted in a homogeneous time plot and distinguished using a gradient colour scale for longitudinal comparison between periods.

```{r stp-demo, fig.width = 8, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:stp-demo-cap)"}
PBS %>%
  filter(ATC2 == "A10") %>%
  select(Month, Concession, Type, Cost) %>%
  summarise(TotalC = sum(Cost)) %>%
  mutate(Cost = TotalC / 1e6) %>%
  gg_season(Cost, labels = "both") +
  theme_bw() +
  labs(
    y = "$ (millions)",
    title = "Seasonal plot: Anti-diabetic drug sales"
  )
```

(ref:stp-demo-cap) **ggplot2**-based seasonal time series plot. Produced with the **feasts** package for the monthly anti-diabetic drug sales in Australia [@fpp3d]. The plot allows for both visualisation of intra-seasonal patterns and inter-seasonal variations shown as a positive trend in drug sales from year to year.

Nevertheless, interpreting connected time plots relies on the visual alignment of positions to the xy-scales in the Cartesian coordinates. Such visual alignments can be challenging upon the absence of explicit gridlines and axes, such as when the plot is fitted as a part of trellis displays [@trellis], in which the trend and scale of variations become ambiguous. As such, it is common to fill the area under the curve to emphasise the temporal variation in the plot [@dataviz-ts].

## HTML widgets for interactive graphics

### Development of web applications with R {#sec:shiny}

The **shiny** package [@shiny] provides a framework for developing web applications with **R** code [@R2021], both user and developer-friendly. It enables **R** users with no prior knowledge of HTML, CSS and JavaScript to create custom web applications with sophisticated functionality with template UI components and a server powered with reactive programming.

Reactive programming focuses only on the evaluation of the changes of values over time, which is the core computation logic behind **shiny** [@mshiny], significantly simplifying the workflow design. Each change in reactive values is observed as an event by pre-defined callback functions, and workflows are executed as responses to events observed. Reactivity is cached such that the reactive values keep the previously evaluated result for each call, as callbacks to them upon event observations update the reactive once and globally, thus consistent for being shared across different functionalities. The cached feature of reactivity allows users in defining abstract workflows without conceiving low-level data and programming logic by restricting the evaluation to merely reactions to events, including user actions and internal value change. Reactivity is also lazy, for no expressions are evaluated until being called, which avoids repeated evaluations of expressions leading to wastage in computational resources.

The user interface of **shiny** applications provides the front-end inputs and output display from the back end server logic. The collection of user input is the primary source of change of reactive values, events that trigger the evaluation of expressions in the back end server logic. The results of the evaluated expressions are rendered as the outputs, which may be as simple as prints of R objects or as sophisticated as HTML interactive graphics.

### Interactive graphics {#sec:int-graphics}

It is usually tempting to fit all the information in a single display upon data visualisation. To avoid excessive cognitive load to viewers, the need for selective presentation of information motivated the introduction of interactive graphics [@intg]. The primary purpose of utilising graphical interactivity is to provide a navigated data exploration, either coarse-to-granular or the opposite, such that only the user-chosen details of a broad summary are dynamically shown, reducing the wastage of limited spatial recourses on display. Alternatively, interactive graphics are used to establish dynamic linkings between plots [@intg].

The selective presentation of information in interactive graphics is mainly achieved by hover-over tooltips and drill-down. Tooltips, initially introduced by @tt in *Windows NT 3.51*, refer to tags of brief descriptive messages upon hovering over graphical elements in the context of interactive graphics, temporarily hiding granular details of a coarser summary until user input which allows a top-down approach to preliminary data exploration. Nevertheless, tooltips are dynamic displays that vanish as the cursor moves away. As such, drill-down [@plotly] and click triggered popups are often used as supplements to tooltips in need of stable auxiliary graphics.

```{r tt-demo, fig.width = 7, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:tt-demo-cap)"}
include_graphics("figures/tt-demo.png")
```

(ref:tt-demo-cap) A demonstration of tooltips with **Echarts.js** via **echarts4r**. A tag with informative messages including the date and observed AQI value is shown upon cursor hover-over the data point.

Linked views of multiple graphics are a powerful method for deconstructing high-dimensional data, achieved via either client or server-side linking [@plotly]. The client-side linking employs internal graphical queries without callbacks to the application server, with examples including internal connections (e.g., brush and linked filters) in **plotly** [@plotly] and **echarts4r** [@echarts4r]. Alternatively, server-side linkings involve queries to the server environment via callbacks (Section \@ref(sec:shiny)), mainly for intermodular linking of different types of plots.

A special application of server-side linking is to facilitate selection control in interactive maps. In addition to the positioning and navigational functions of interactive maps, they are a native geographical user interface for click or hover-and-show inputs and outputs.

## Visual analysis for temporal air quality data

Temporal air quality data requires domain-specific graphic tools for exploratory visual analysis. This section covers examples of visualising air quality in meteorological and temporal aspects.

### Wind roses {#sec:wind-rose}

Wind speed and direction are critical meteorological parameters that affect the concentration of ambient air pollutants by altering their transportation, diffusion and accumulation [@wind]. The visual evaluation of wind as vectors requires specialised graphics capable of depicting the directional nature of wind. In conjunction with the requirement for visual association analysis between wind and air pollution, a temporal-proportion-based wind rose plot is proposed and implemented on the **openair** package [@openair], which is an application of the stacked polar bar plots. Variations of temporal-proportion wind rose plots include contour wind roses [@cwr] and standard vector-deviation wind roses [@vdwr]. A temporal-proportion wind rose can be extended to pollution rose, replacing the mapping of wind speed to pollutants.

```{r wr-demo, fig.width = 7, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:wr-demo-cap)"}
pollutionRose(openair::mydata, pollutant = "nox")
```

(ref:wr-demo-cap) Pollution rose. Produced with **openair** [@openair], which depicts the proportion of time (radius of the segmental arches) the wind is bounded from each direction (angle) observing the levels of NO<sub>x</sub> (colour).

### Autocorrelation plots

Trend analysis of ambient air pollutant concentrations is a critical component of the air quality management strategy [@aqi], which is commonly carried out preliminarily with linear models. Nonetheless, mutual independence of the residuals is the core assumption of all linear models; as such, the temporal dependence of air quality data between successive observations needs to be captured [@lm]. The autocorrelation plots visually provide preliminary insights into the type of correlation structure present in the series prior to analysis [@acf]. The autocorrelation plots are also a tool for model diagnostics and evaluation.

```{r acf-demo, fig.width = 8, out.width = "100%", fig.cap = "(ref:acf-demo-cap)"}
(aus_production %>%
  filter(year(Quarter) >= 2000) %>%
  ACF(Beer) %>%
  autoplot()) +
  (aus_production %>%
    filter(year(Quarter) >= 2000) %>%
    PACF(Beer) %>%
    autoplot()) +
  plot_annotation(title = "Australian beer production") &
  theme_bw()
```

(ref:acf-demo-cap) A **ggplot2**-based autocorrelation plot (left) and partial autocorrelation plot (right) of quarterly lags with the **feasts** package for Australian beer production [@fpp3d]. The sample (partial) autocorrelation function of each lag is compared to a significance threshold of $\pm \frac{\phi^{-1} (1 - \frac{\alpha}{2})}{\sqrt{n}}$.
